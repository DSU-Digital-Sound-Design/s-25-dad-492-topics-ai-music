**Final Project Options: AI and Music (Ungrading-Based)**

You are invited to choose a final project that best reflects your learning, curiosity, and creative or critical response to the themes we've explored this semester. Each option includes guidance, prompts, and a set of reflection questions. There are no fixed rubrics. You will assess your own work through a written reflection that explains what you set out to do, what you learned, and what you created. Take risks, ask questions, be honest.

See the [library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5817982/ai_music_sources/library) for possible sources. 

Also see the [AI Tools overview](ai-tools.md) if you want to use or critique the AI musical tools that we haven't yet talked about in class.

**How You’ll Be Assessed**

This final project uses an ungrading approach. You won’t receive a traditional grade for your final project. Instead, you’ll reflect on your own learning, process, and creative or critical decisions. Your final submission should demonstrate honest engagement, personal growth, and thoughtful communication — whatever form your project takes.

I will offer you written feedback celebrating your insights, questions, and risks. Since a final course grade is required by DSU, you’ll be invited to recommend your own grade based on your engagement, effort, and learning.

### What I’ll Be Looking For:

- **Engagement** – Did you meaningfully explore the questions or ideas in your chosen prompt?
- **Reflection** – Did you show awareness of your process, challenges, and learning?
- **Follow-through** – Did you complete the project in a thoughtful and intentional way?

There is no one “right” project. You are encouraged to define success on your own terms.

**1. Humans vs. Machines: A Sound Essay**  
**Type**: Creative or Critical  
**Prompt**: Create an experimental audio piece or sonic essay that juxtaposes human-made and AI-generated music. Optionally include interviews or voiceovers. Reflect on what makes music feel “authentic” and how labor is involved in AI and human composition.

**Reflection Questions**:
- What drew you to the topic?
- What choices did you make to highlight differences or similarities between AI and human expression?
- What new questions emerged from making this piece?

---

**2. Remix Ethics: An Audio Collage & Legal Analysis**  
**Type**: Creative + Critical  
**Prompt**: Create a remix or collage using AI-generated or public domain samples. Accompany it with an analysis of originality and ownership in the age of AI. 

**Reflection Questions**:
- How did you choose your sources and why?
- What tensions or contradictions did you discover about copyright, authorship, or remix culture?
- What do you think needs to change in the music industry to reflect current realities?

---

**6. Hidden Layers: Sonifying AI’s Feature Space**  
**Type**: Creative or Experimental  
**Prompt**: Sonify or creatively use features from machine listening models (e.g., MFCCs, spectral centroid). Build a piece or system that explores how machines “hear.”

**Reflection Questions**:
- What did you learn by working with audio features directly?
- Did the machine's perception align with your own?
- How do features limit or expand musical creativity?

---

**7. The Artist in the Machine: A Sonic Fiction**  
**Type**: Creative Narrative  
**Prompt**: Create a speculative podcast, zine, or sound story imagining a future where AI reshapes music, labor, or identity. Mix narrative, fictional tools, and sound design.

**Reflection Questions**:
- What future did you imagine, and why?
- How did you use audio to bring your ideas to life?
- What values guided your vision of this future?

---

**8. Personal Toolkit for AI Music Creation**  
**Type**: Portfolio + Reflection  
**Prompt**: Create 3–5 short sketches using different AI tools. For each, reflect on your process and experience. You can present these in any form (audio, video, web, etc.).

**Reflection Questions**:
- What did you try, and what did you learn from each experiment?
- Which tools inspired you? Which didn’t?
- How would you explain your toolkit to someone new to this topic?

---

**9. AI Listening Journal & Creative Response**  
**Type**: Critical + Creative  
**Prompt**: Keep a journal of your responses to AI music over several weeks. Then, create a short piece or essay in response to one work that moved you, annoyed you, or changed your thinking.

**Reflection Questions**:
- What emotions or ideas did AI music provoke in you?
- Did your thinking shift over time?
- How did you channel your response into your final work?

---

**10. Collaborative Experiment: What Happens If…**  
**Type**: Group-Based Creative Inquiry  
**Prompt**: Work in a small group to design and test an absurd, speculative, or playful musical experiment. Follow the thread of a weird question — what if an AI composed only with bird calls? What if a model misunderstood genre entirely?

**Reflection Questions**:
- What was your initial question or spark?
- What did you discover through trying?
- What felt fun, frustrating, or unexpected?

---

**11. Zine or Website: AI Music + Me**  
**Type**: Personal Narrative + Curation  
**Prompt**: Create a personal zine or digital artifact that reflects your thoughts, sketches, reactions, and growth around AI and music this semester.

**Reflection Questions**:
- How has your thinking evolved?
- What tensions or questions are still unresolved for you?
- What would you tell your past self about this course?

---

**12. Failed Experiments Archive**  
**Type**: Experimental Log + Reflection  
**Prompt**: Document 3–5 “failures” — moments when your AI music projects didn’t go as planned. Treat them as studies in process, not shortcomings.

**Reflection Questions**:
- What did you try, and what happened?
- What did you learn from the failure?
- What new ideas or insights emerged?

---

**13. Resisting the Machine: A Critical Response to AI and Music**  
**Type**: Critical, Reflective, or Hybrid  
**Prompt**: If you didn’t like the class or didn’t connect with AI and music, this is your space. Write a critique, create an artwork, or build a sound collage that expresses your concerns or discomfort. Your goal is not to please but to think deeply and honestly.

**Reflection Questions**:
- What felt alienating or unconvincing about AI and music?
- Did anything change your view, even slightly?
- What kind of musical future do you hope for?

---

**Final Submission Requirements**:
- Your creative or critical work (format is flexible)
- A short written reflection (1–2 pages or equivalent)
- Optional: any process notes, sketches, or code you'd like to include

Let your curiosity, doubt, creativity, or critique guide you. There is no one right answer — only thoughtful, honest, and engaged work.
