## What is Creativity?

> Now, this discussion would be easy if we had a clear, concrete definition of “creativity.” But we donʼt. We have intuitions, and we have the way the word is used...

{{% note %}}
"creativity" is notoriously hard to define. There's no single, universally accepted definition, neither among experts nor the general public. We mostly rely on intuition and how the word is commonly used. This ambiguity makes discussing machine creativity difficult from the outset.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: Your Definition

*   Before we dive deeper, what does 'creativity' mean to *you*?
*   What are the first words or ideas that come to mind when you hear the term?
*   Is it about the person, the process, or the product?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To get the audience thinking from their own perspectives right away and to highlight the inherent ambiguity discussed on the previous slide. Encourage a brief brainstorm or sharing of initial thoughts.

## Defining Creativity for Machines?

> Our definitions donʼt tell us anything about machine-made creativity because we havenʼt ever considered machines as creative before.

{{% note %}}
This highlights a key challenge raised in the source material, similar to the Brainard reading. Our existing frameworks for understanding creativity were developed with humans (and perhaps some animals) in mind. They weren't built to evaluate whether a non-biological, programmed entity could be creative. The question itself is relatively new, prompted by technological advancements.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Technology Forces the Question

> In fact, the new technology helps us attempt to clarify what is or isnʼt “creativity,” by providing provocative real-world examples. Just as new technologies do with “art,”...

{{% note %}}
The emergence of AI that *appears* creative forces us to refine our definitions. By seeing what machines *can* do, we are prompted to delineate what truly constitutes human creativity, often defining it in contrast to machine output. This parallels historical debates where new technologies (like photography) challenged existing definitions of "art." Similarly, AI challenges our definitions of creativity and, in our context, music.

## "Creativity" as "Making Creative Things"
### A Product-Focused View

{{% note %}}
This section explores one common approach to defining creativity: focusing solely on the output or product. If the *thing* created is judged as creative, does that suffice?
{{% /note %}}

---

### Definition Attempt: Valuable & New

- Creativity is sometimes defined as making something:
  -   **Valuable**
  -  **New** (Surprising, Unique, or  Novel)

{{% note %}}
This is a common starting point for defining creativity based on the product. The created item should possess both value and novelty. However, as the Brainard reading also suggested, both "value" and "newness" are complex concepts with multiple interpretations. We'll explore these next.
{{% /note %}}

---

### What is "Value"?

*   Artistic Value?
*   Emotional Value?
*   *Epistemic Value?*

{{% note %}}
What kind of value are we talking about? Is it the aesthetic appeal, the emotional resonance it evokes? The source material introduces *epistemic value* – the value associated with achievements like gaining true belief, knowledge, or understanding. This type of value is particularly relevant to the *process* of creation. How does human-created value differ from something an animal or natural process might produce?
{{% /note %}}

---

### Epistemic Value & The Ignorance Principle

> **The ignorance principle:** If someone is creative in producing some item, she cannot know in advance of being creative precisely both the end at which she is aiming and the means to achieve it. (Gaut, 2018)

{{% note %}}
Gaut proposes that genuine creativity involves a degree of uncertainty. The creator doesn't know the exact final form *and* the exact steps to get there beforehand. This suggests that the *process* of discovery and navigating the unknown is inherent to creativity and contributes epistemic value. Think about writing a song - you might have a starting point, but the final result often emerges through experimentation and unexpected turns.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Ignorance Principle: Reflections

*   **Possible Counterpoints:**
    *   Sol LeWitt's detailed instructions for wall drawings.
    *   Performing a meticulously notated symphony.
*   **Implication:** More ignorance = More creativity?
    *   Is highly improvised free jazz (maximum ignorance of outcome) always seen as the *most* creative? Often not.

{{% note %}}
Does the ignorance principle hold up universally? Consider conceptual art like Sol LeWitt's, where the *idea* and instructions are the art, and the execution is precise. Or a masterful orchestral performance following a score exactly. Are these not creative? This principle seems to value improvisation and emergent processes more highly. However, extreme unpredictability, like some free jazz, isn't always perceived by audiences as the pinnacle of creativity, suggesting a balance is often preferred.
{{% /note %}}

---

### What is "Newness" (Novelty)?

*   New to the world? (*Historical*)
*   New to the creator/viewer? (*Psychological*)

{{% note %}}
Novelty, the other pillar of the product-based definition, also has nuances. The source text introduces Boden's distinction: *Historical* novelty (never existed before anywhere) and *Psychological* novelty (new to the individual experiencing it).
{{% /note %}}

---

### Boden's Two Types of Novelty

1.  **Historical Creativity:** The output is unprecedented in human history. (Rare)
2.  **Psychological Creativity:** The output is new *to the individual* encountering or creating it. (Common)

{{% note %}}
Historical novelty is the standard often sought in science or major artistic breakthroughs – something truly groundbreaking. Psychological novelty is far more common and relatable. It's the personal sense of discovery or encountering something unfamiliar, like a child's drawing or hearing a new genre of music for the first time. This acknowledges everyday creativity. Most things we call "creative" likely fall under psychological novelty ("nothing new under the sun").
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: Types of Novelty

*   Think about things *you* find creative personally vs. major breakthroughs you've heard about.
*   Which type of novelty – Psychological (new to you/the creator) or Historical (new to the world) – feels more common or relevant in your own creative experiences or appreciation?
*   Does one type feel more valuable than the other? Why?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To help the audience internalize the distinction between psychological and historical novelty by relating it to their own experiences. This can lead to discussion about everyday creativity vs. groundbreaking innovation.
{{% /note %}}

---

### "Little-C" vs. "Big-C" Creativity

*   **little-c:** Personal creativity (e.g., a child's drawing, everyday problem-solving). Often psychologically novel.
*   **Big-C:** Societally impactful creativity (e.g., a major invention, a revolutionary artwork). Often historically novel and highly valued.

{{% note %}}
This distinction relates closely to value and novelty. "Little-c" creativity is personal, perhaps novel only psychologically, and its value might be primarily personal or familial. "Big-C" creativity changes paradigms, introduces something historically novel, and has broader societal value. We intuitively understand this difference.
{{% /note %}}

---

### The Product-Only Trap

*   A potential conclusion: Creativity *only* requires the *product* to be creative. The process doesn't matter.

{{% note %}}
If we define creativity solely by the perceived value and novelty of the output, it leads to the idea that *how* it was made is irrelevant. If a thing looks creative, it is creative, regardless of origin (human, machine, random process). The author suggests this is a problematic simplification, leading into the McNamara fallacy.
{{% /note %}}

---

### The McNamara Fallacy

Making decisions based *solely* on quantitative observations, ignoring qualitative factors.

*   What does this leave out?
*   Relation to the Freesound project?

{{% note %}}
The McNamara Fallacy warns against relying only on what can be easily measured, ignoring other crucial aspects. If we judge AI creativity only on quantifiable aspects of the output (e.g., adheres to musical rules, generates novel chord progressions statistically) we might miss crucial qualitative factors like emotional depth, intent, cultural context, or the nature of the creative *process*. How might this apply to evaluating the sounds generated in the Freesound project? Are we just measuring technical qualities, or also considering the context and process?
{{% /note %}}

---

### The Fallacy Applied to AI

*   If a machine output is *rated* as creative by people...
*   ...then the machine *must be* creative?

{{% note %}}
This is the logical step some take when applying the product-only view to AI, often influenced by the McNamara Fallacy. They measure human perception of the output. If humans say the AI's song/image is creative, the conclusion drawn is that the AI itself possesses creativity. The author argues this is flawed, especially given current tech. It ignores the *how* and equates perceived quality with inherent creative capacity.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: Judging AI Output

*   If an AI (like Suno, Stable Diffusion, etc.) creates something (music, image) that seems technically proficient and novel...
*   How much 'creativity' should we attribute *to the AI itself*?
*   What factors, beyond the perceived quality of the output, should we consider? (Think about the McNamara Fallacy).

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To directly apply the concept of the McNamara Fallacy and the product-only view to current AI tools. Encourages critical thinking about whether impressive output automatically equates to machine creativity, prompting consideration of process, intent, context etc.

### We Already Have "Creative" Systems?

If output is the only measure, then rule-based generative systems we've had for decades could be called "creative."

*   Harold Cohen's AARON
*   The Mandelbrot Set

{{% note %}}
The author points out that if we accept the "output is everything" definition, then we've had "creative" machines for a long time. Systems that follow rules or algorithms to generate novel and sometimes aesthetically pleasing results aren't new. This challenges the idea that current AI is uniquely crossing the threshold into creativity simply because its outputs are more sophisticated. Let's look at two examples.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Example: Harold Cohen's AARON

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkrJwURBEfg?si=UEmiXYEYfRnX8OIz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
AARON was a computer program developed by Harold Cohen starting in the 1970s. It could autonomously generate original drawings based on rules Cohen programmed about composition, form, and color. The outputs were often seen as artistic, but AARON was executing Cohen's instructions and aesthetic principles. Is AARON creative, or is Cohen creative *through* AARON?
{{% /note %}}

---

### Example: The Mandelbrot Set

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b005iHf8Z3g?si=piuazH6K4GUYUd9K" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Code Example](https://p5js.org/examples/math-and-physics-mandelbrot/)

{{% note %}}
The Mandelbrot set generates infinitely complex and often beautiful fractal patterns based on a simple mathematical formula. The *output* can seem incredibly creative and novel. But can we call a mathematical equation itself "creative"? Most would attribute the creativity to the mathematician who discovered/explored it or the programmer who visualized it, not the formula itself. This highlights the issue with judging creativity purely by the visual output.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Example: Art with Rules

*   Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings: Conceptual art where the creativity lies in the instructions, not just the final execution.
*   [See examples](https://www.wikiart.org/en/sol-lewitt)

{{% note %}}
Sol LeWitt created instructions for complex geometric wall drawings, which others would then execute. The artistic creation was the *concept* and the *ruleset*. While the output follows instructions precisely, LeWitt is considered highly creative. This contrasts with the idea that simply following instructions *cannot* be creative, but reframes it: perhaps the creativity lies in *devising* the instructions (the process of rule creation), rather than just executing them.

## Productivity or Humanity?
### Why Study Creativity?

{{% note %}}
This section shifts focus from defining creativity by its product to considering the motivations behind studying it and the importance of the process, particularly in relation to *human* creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Historical Motivations for Study

1.  **Companies:** Increase human productivity -> Economic value. (Output-focused)
2.  **Psychologists:** Understand human intelligence/behavior -> Improve it / Self-actualization. (Process/Human-focused)

{{% note %}}
Historically, the study of creativity has had different goals. Businesses often focused on harnessing creativity for innovation and profit – essentially, getting more valuable *outputs*. Psychologists were often more interested in understanding the human mind, how creativity functions as part of intelligence, behavior, and personal fulfillment (like Maslow's "self-actualization").
{{% /note %}}

---

### Focus: Human-like Creativity

> When we say that an “AI” is creative, then weʼre saying itʼs creative in some way *similar to human creativity*.

{{% note %}}
The author clarifies their focus: when discussing AI creativity, the implicit comparison is usually to *human* creativity. The question isn't just "can it make something new?" but "is it creative *like a person is*?" This immediately brings the *process* and underlying mechanisms into play, not just the output.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Output Is Not Enough

> I do not think that just looking at the outputs is enough. Computer systems work by following instructions, and I think most of us would agree that human “creativity” canʼt just be about following instructions.

{{% note %}}
The author directly challenges the product-only view. They argue that our intuitive understanding of human creativity involves more than just executing instructions, even complex ones. Think about cooking: following a recipe precisely might result in a good dish, but we usually reserve the term "creative" for inventing a new recipe or significantly adapting an existing one through experimentation and intuition. Is devising the instructions (like Sol LeWitt) the creative part?
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: Instructions vs. Creation

*   Consider cooking: Is meticulously following a complex recipe creative?
*   What about adapting the recipe? Inventing a new one from scratch?
*   Where do *you* draw the line between skilled execution based on instructions and a genuinely creative act? How does this relate to computer instructions?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To explore the nuances of the "following instructions" argument using a relatable analogy. Helps distinguish between different levels of agency and originality, and relate that back to the capabilities of algorithms vs. humans.
{{% /note %}}

---

### The "Following Instructions" Argument

> Precisely-following instructions without deviation or autonomy does not seem “creative” to me. (This is a variant of the “Chinese room argument”).

{{% note %}}
This reinforces the previous point. If something simply executes a predetermined set of steps without understanding, deviation, or independent decision-making, it doesn't align with our concept of creativity. The Chinese Room argument similarly suggests that manipulating symbols according to rules doesn't equate to genuine understanding or consciousness.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Nuance: How AI "Instructions" Differ

*   Modern AI doesn't follow explicit human-written rules like a traditional program.
*   They use statistical patterns learned from vast datasets (weights in a neural network).
*   *However*, the author argues, this is still fundamentally different from human creative processes (lacks embodiment, experience, cultural grounding, intent).

{{% note %}}
It's important to acknowledge that Large Language Models or image generators aren't following simple "if-then" rules written by a programmer. They operate on complex statistical models learned from data. BUT, the author argues this *still* isn't analogous to human creativity. The process relies on pattern matching within the data it was trained on, mediated by human tagging and prompts. It lacks the embodied experience, lived history, social interaction, and intentional drive that shape human creation. Does novelty within this statistical space equate to human creative novelty?
{{% /note %}}

## Computational Systems as *Models* of Intelligence

{{% note %}}
If AI isn't creative in the human sense, how should we understand these systems that produce such impressive outputs? The author proposes thinking of them as *models*.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Interpreting Impressive AI Outputs

*   Current systems *can* create surprising, novel, delightful things.
*   Text-to-image outputs can look like something we'd call "creative" if a human made it.
*   So, what's going on?

{{% note %}}
We need a way to reconcile the impressive capabilities of modern AI with the argument that they aren't truly creative in the human sense. The outputs *are* often novel and surprising. How do we frame this?
{{% /note %}}

---

### AI as Models of Intelligence Aspects

> ...we should think of “artificial intelligence” algorithms as **models** of aspects of animal intelligence.

{{% note %}}
The key idea: AI systems are not replications of intelligence but *models* that simulate certain *aspects* or *phenomena* of intelligence. Just like a weather model simulates weather patterns but isn't the weather itself.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Two Kinds of Models (Analogy)

1.  **Models approximating outward behavior:** Mimic the *appearance* of intelligence/creativity.
    *   Like a **helicopter** flying (achieves flight, but mechanism is totally different from a bird).
2.  **Models replicating internal mechanisms:** Aim to simulate underlying processes (cognitive, neural).
    *   Like trying to build an **ornithopter** (attempts flight based on bird-like principles, even if imperfectly).

{{% note %}}
The author uses a helpful analogy. Some AI aims simply to reproduce the *results* (the output, the behavior) of intelligence, like a helicopter achieves flight using rotors, completely unlike a bird's wings. Other AI research *tries* to model the internal *processes* thought to underlie intelligence (e.g., simulating neural networks), more like trying to build a bird-like flying machine.

### Current AI: Modeling Phenomena

> “AI” models are optimized and trained to model the **phenomena** of human dialogue and picture-making... but the underlying mechanisms are almost entirely different.

{{% note %}}
The author argues that current generative AI falls mostly into the first category: they are excellent at modeling the *outward appearance* (the phenomena) of human creation (text, images, music). They achieve this "flight" via mechanisms (statistical pattern matching on massive datasets) that are fundamentally different from the biological, cognitive, social, and cultural mechanisms underlying human creativity. They are helicopters, not birds.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Creative Processes
### The Missing Element

{{% note %}}
This section argues that the crucial difference lies in the *process*. Current AI doesn't model the *process* of human creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Beyond the "Inspiration Myth"

*   Simplistic views emphasize a sudden "flash of insight."
*   Hollywood trope: Scientist/artist sees something -> instant breakthrough.

{{% note %}}
Creativity is often romanticized as a sudden, mysterious bolt from the blue – the "Eureka!" moment. While inspiration plays a role, this myth downplays the critical importance of the surrounding work and process.
{{% /note %}}

---

### The Reality: Process & Hard Work

> Even if Kekulé solved the chemical structure of benzene in a lucky vision... it was because heʼd spent years studying chemical bonds and working on the problem.

{{% note %}}
Real creativity, even moments that seem like sudden insight, usually happens within a context of prolonged effort, experimentation, and deep engagement with the domain. Kekulé's dream about the snake biting its tail was meaningful *because* his mind was already saturated with the problem of benzene's structure after long study. The insight needed fertile ground prepared by hard work. As artists, we know this: ideas often come *while* working, not before.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Reflect: Your Creative Experiences

*   Think about something *you* made that felt creative.
*   How much did you know the final outcome when you started?
*   How predictable was the process?
*   How did unpredictability relate to the feeling of creativity?

{{% note %}}
The author invites personal reflection. Consider your own experiences. When you felt most creative, did you follow a precise plan, or was there an element of discovery, surprise, and adaptation along the way? Often, the process involves a back-and-forth, where the work itself suggests new directions you couldn't have predicted at the start.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Discovery Through Working

> It wasnʼt the initial idea that made the work... the creative idea was *discovered through the process of working*.

{{% note %}}
This emphasizes that creativity often isn't about perfectly executing a pre-formed idea. Instead, the idea itself evolves and is refined *during* the act of creation. The interaction between the creator and the medium, the mistakes, the experiments – this *is* the creative process. One step leads unexpectedly to the next.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Key Takeaway 1: Process Matters

> In short, creativity isnʼt just about what you produce. **Itʼs how you got there.**

{{% note %}}
This is a central argument of the text. To evaluate creativity, especially when comparing human and machine, we cannot ignore the process. The journey of discovery, the navigating of uncertainty, the intentional choices made along the way – these are integral to what we mean by creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Key Takeaway 2: Surprise for the Creator

> ...really creative works arenʼt just surprising to the audience… really creative works are **surprising to the person who made them.**

{{% note %}}
A hallmark of a truly creative process, according to the author, is that the outcome holds surprises even for the creator. It signifies that something genuinely new emerged during the work, something not fully predictable from the starting point. Does current AI experience surprise at its own outputs? How does this metric relate to the work done in class? Were there elements of surprise in your projects? Was it controlled surprise or overwhelming randomness?
{{% /note %}}
s
---

## Discussion Point: The Surprise Factor

*   Reflecting on your own creative projects (for this class or elsewhere): Was the final result surprising *to you*?
*   Did the process lead you somewhere unexpected compared to your initial idea?
*   How did that 'surprise factor' (or lack thereof) affect your feeling of having been creative? Does this criterion resonate with you?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To connect the author's proposed criterion (surprise for the creator) to the audience's lived experiences. Prompts reflection on their own creative processes and whether this element of unpredictability feels essential.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Goals: Open-Ended or Well-Defined?

{{% note %}}
Building on the importance of process, this section introduces another key difference: the nature of the goals in human vs. computational creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Open-Endedness: A Missing Attribute

> Another attribute of human creativity thatʼs missing from computational systems is its **open-endedness**.

{{% note %}}
Much human creativity doesn't start with a perfectly defined target. The goal itself might be vague or evolve during the process. Current AI systems typically operate with more constrained objectives, even if complex. The user note reflects this well - starting with one idea (abstract) and discovering a more interesting path during the work is characteristic of open-ended human creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Types of Problems

*   **Open-Ended Problems:** Vague goals, process shapes outcome.
    *   "Make an artwork"
    *   "Invent something new"
    *   "Explore this musical idea"
*   **Well-Defined Problems:** Concrete goals, clear success criteria.
    *   "Solve this math equation"
    *   "Win a game of Chess/Go"
    *   "Optimize this parameter"

{{% note %}}
The author contrasts these two types. Open-ended problems lack a single 'right' answer or a predefined metric for success. The process is exploratory. Well-defined problems have clearer targets and often quantifiable measures of success (solved, won, optimized). AI has excelled at well-defined problems.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Different Kinds of "Creative" Solutions

*   Solutions to *both* open-ended and well-defined problems might be *called* creative.
*   BUT, the *nature* of the creativity involved is different.

{{% note %}}
Finding a novel strategy in Go (well-defined) can seem creative. Creating a groundbreaking artwork (open-ended) is also creative. The author argues that while we use the same word, the underlying processes and the type of challenge are distinct. The creativity in exploring ambiguity and defining the problem itself (common in arts) differs from the creativity in finding an optimal solution within defined constraints (common in games/math).
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: AI & Problem Types

*   Do you think current AI is better suited for tackling:
    *   **Well-defined problems** (like optimizing a system, winning a complex game)?
    *   **Open-ended problems** (like "make meaningful art," "discover a new scientific principle")?
*   Why? What limitations prevent AI from excelling at truly open-ended creativity as defined here?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To get the audience to synthesize the distinction between problem types and current AI capabilities. Encourages discussion on the specific challenges AI faces when dealing with ambiguity, emergent goals, and the lack of predefined objectives common in human creativity.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Toward New Kinds of Models

{{% note %}}
Given these limitations (lack of process modeling, difficulty with open-endedness), what might future AI look like in relation to creativity?
{{% /note %}}

---

### Modeling Open-Ended Creativity?

*   Can we build computational models that capture the *process* of open-ended creativity?
*   Hertzmann's attempt: A model generalizing optimization (ICCC 2022).

{{% note %}}
The author ponders if algorithms could be designed to better simulate the exploratory, goal-evolving nature of open-ended creativity. They mention their own theoretical work attempting to frame this, suggesting it's an active area of research, moving beyond current optimization-focused approaches.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Feasibility and Limitations

*   Uncertainty if such models can be fully realized.
*   Even if successful, they would still be *models*.

{{% note %}}
There's no guarantee that such complex, open-ended processes can be effectively captured algorithmically. And even if researchers succeed in creating more sophisticated models, the author maintains a crucial distinction...
{{% /note %}}

---

### Algorithms Remain Algorithms

> Ultimately, all of our algorithms are still just going to be algorithms, sets of instructions... sometimes they will mimic well the phenomena of human creativity, and in other ways they wonʼt.

{{% note %}}
This is the final takeaway. Regardless of how sophisticated AI becomes, it remains fundamentally algorithmic – executing instructions based on its programming and training data. It might get better at *simulating* the outward appearances (phenomena) of human creativity, perhaps even modeling aspects of the process or open-endedness. However, it won't *be* human creativity, which is deeply intertwined with consciousness, embodiment, culture, history, and lived experience – aspects current AI lacks. They remain powerful tools and fascinating models, but not creative entities in the human sense.
