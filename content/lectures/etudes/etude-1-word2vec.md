# Sonic Poetry Generator - One Week Assignment

## Overview
In this week-long assignment, you will create a sonic poetry generator that explores the relationship between words and sound. Building upon our in-class examples, you will implement one musical extension that demonstrates your understanding of synthesis, sound design, or music theory.

## Core Requirements

### Basic Implementation (Required)
1. Load and use the word2vec model to find related words
2. Create a basic melody system
3. Display words on screen with animation
4. Include start/stop functionality
5. Handle errors appropriately

### Musical Extension (Choose One)
Select one of these extensions to enhance the sonic qualities of your generator. Each option emphasizes different aspects of sound design and music theory.

#### Extension 1: Timbre Evolution
Create meaningful relationships between words and synthesizer timbre. This extension is ideal if you understand sound synthesis basics and how different waveforms and envelope settings create distinct tonal qualities.

Implementation guidance:
- Start by modifying the oscillator type between sine and triangle for different words
- Experiment with attack and release times to create different note characteristics
- Consider how word relationships might map to timbral qualities (e.g., similar words = warm tones, distant words = bright tones)

#### Extension 2: Musical Intervals
Design melodic relationships using specific musical intervals based on word relationships. This extension works well if you have a strong understanding of music theory and how different intervals create various emotional qualities.

Implementation guidance:
- Begin with simple mappings like major thirds for similar words
- Add minor intervals for more distant relationships
- Create small collections of intervals that work well together
- Consider using pentatonic scales to ensure pleasant combinations

#### Extension 3: Effects Processing
Create an evolving sonic space using audio effects. This extension is appropriate if you understand reverb, delay, and how they contribute to sound design.

Implementation guidance:
- Start with subtle reverb adjustments
- Add delay for more distant word relationships
- Keep effect levels moderate to maintain clarity
- Consider how the space changes with different word combinations

## Development Schedule

### Day 1-2: Core Setup
- Get the basic word generation working
- Implement fundamental audio playback

### Day 3-4: Basic Sonification
- Create simple melody system
- Ensure audio triggers correctly with words

### Day 5-6: Musical Extension
- Implement your chosen extension
- Test different parameter settings

### Day 7: Refinement
- Adjust and fine-tune your sound design
- Document your creative decisions

## Assessment Rubric (15 points)

### Core Functionality (7 points)
- Word generation works correctly (2 points)
- Basic audio plays reliably (2 points)
- Visual display functions (2 points)
- Start/stop works properly (1 point)

### Musical Extension (5 points)
- Sonic implementation (2 points)
- Musical effectiveness (2 points)
- Creative use of parameters (1 point)

### Documentation and Process (3 points)
- Documentation of musical choices (1 point)
- Clear explanation of parameters (1 point)
- Thoughtful sound design decisions (1 point)

## Submission Requirements
1. Your code with clear comments explaining audio parameters
2. A brief write-up explaining:
   - Which extension you chose and why
   - How your sound design relates to word relationships
   - Your musical decision-making process
3. A short video demonstration with audio (1-2 minutes)

## Tips for Success
- Focus on making meaningful sonic relationships
- Keep your parameter changes moderate and musical
- Test your sounds with different words
- Document which parameter settings worked best
- Consider the overall musical experience
- Make intentional choices about your sound design

Remember that your grade will focus more on thoughtful sound design and musical choices than on coding complexity. Take time to experiment with different parameters and document what works best for your artistic goals.
