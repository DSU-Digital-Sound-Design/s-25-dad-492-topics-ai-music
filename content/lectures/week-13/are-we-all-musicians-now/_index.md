## Listening Challenge: Human or AI?

*   Let's start with a quick listening challenge.
*   You will hear 4-5 short music clips.
*   One clip is part of an **original song segment I created myself**.
*   The other clips are **continuations generated by Suno AI**, prompted using my original piece.
*   **Your task:** Listen closely and decide which clip (**A, B, C...**) you think is the **original human creation**.

{{% note %}}
**Purpose:** To immediately engage the audience and demonstrate the potential ambiguity between human-created and AI-generated music, setting the stage for the discussion on authenticity, imitation, and musicianship. This primes the audience to think critically about the sounds they hear.
**Setup:** Have your audio clips ready to play:
    1.  Your original human-created music segment.
    2.  The Suno-generated continuations based on that segment.
    Clearly label them (A, B, C...). **Crucially, know which letter corresponds to your original piece!**
**Execution:** Play each clip clearly. You might want to play them through once, then perhaps repeat them. Give people a moment to decide.
**Interaction:** Use a quick, informal method to gather guesses (show of hands is often easiest). **IMPORTANT: Do NOT reveal the correct answer yet.** Note the distribution of guesses.
**Transition:** "Okay, interesting results! Keep your guess in mind. Whether it was easy or hard to tell the difference touches on exactly what we're exploring today: As AI like Suno gets better at mimicking or even extending human creativity, how do we perceive the results? What does it mean for authenticity and even our definition of a musician? Let's dive in..." (You can reveal the answer later in the presentation or at the end to maintain suspense).

## Abstract Overview

-   Suno generates music via prompts, bypassing traditional composing/performing.
-   Raises questions about **authenticity** without a conventional "auteur".
-   Paper argues: AI music *can* achieve authenticity, leading to a new (contested) form of **musicianship**.

{{% note %}}
The core tension explored is how we perceive music created not through traditional human skill and intent, but through AI interpreting user prompts. Can this music be "real"? Can the users be considered "musicians"? This paper suggests yes, but acknowledges the debate.

## Introduction: Before Suno

**Early AI & Music Experiments:**

-   **1957:** "Illiac Suite for String Quartet" (Hiller & Isaacson) - Early computer composition.
-   **1965:** Ray Kurzweil's pattern-based composition software.
-   **1997:** David Cope's EMI program mimics composer styles.
    -   [Tech Closeup: Music Professor - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFImmDsNGdE&t=115s)
    -   Albums released using "Emily Howell" algorithm (2009, 2012).

{{% note %}}
The idea of computers creating music isn't new. These early examples show decades of exploration, from rule-based systems to style emulation. However, these were often academic or experimental, not widely accessible tools capable of generating convincing vocals and diverse genres on demand.

## Introduction: The Rise of Generative AI Music

-   **2024:** Platforms like **Suno** and **Udio** bring generative AI music to the masses.
-   **Challenge:** Music's complex structure (sound + time) made AI progress slower than in text/image.
-   **Suno's Breakthrough:** Text/audio/image/video-to-music interface aims to bridge this gap.

{{% note %}}
While precursors existed, 2024 marked a significant shift with user-friendly online platforms. Music's temporal and harmonic complexity presented unique hurdles for AI. Suno's multimodal input approach represents a major step in making sophisticated music generation accessible.

## Introduction: Suno's Impact & Debate

-   Suno pushes boundaries of "performance" and "composition".
-   Invites listeners to become producers/creators.
-   **BUT:** Lack of direct human performance sparks debate on **authenticity** and **agency**.
    -   *Is prompting truly active composition or closer to passive consumption?*
    -   *The paper acknowledges this debate*

{{% note %}}
Suno challenges our traditional understanding of musicianship. If you type a prompt and get a song, did *you* compose it? Did *you* perform it? It shifts the user role from purely passive listener towards something more active, but the *degree* of agency is debatable. This deviation from traditional processes is central to the authenticity discussion, as seen in online commentary (e.g., Beato, ColdFusion videos and comments).

## Introduction: Key Research Questions

1.  **Are we all musicians now?** Has Suno democratized musicianship?
2.  **Can AI-generated music be authenticated?** Is there potential for it to be considered "real"?
3.  **How might AI impact music scenes?** Sociocultural dynamics, roles, production futures.

*(What does "authenticating music" mean in this context?)*

{{% note %}}
These three questions guide the paper's exploration. The first probes the definition of 'musician' in the age of AI tools. The second delves into the core concept of authenticity as applied to AI output – not necessarily a formal verification, but whether listeners/communities *accept* it as genuine. The third looks at the broader ripple effects on how music is made, shared, and valued. The literature specifically on AI and (ethno)musicology is still emerging but expected to grow rapidly.
{{% /note %}}

## Authenticity in Music: "Real" Music, "Real" Musicianship

-   Authenticity = "real," "genuine," "honest," "sincere."
-   Crucial concept in (ethno)musicology, especially popular music studies.
-   Discourses of authenticity assign **musical value**.

{{% note %}}
Authenticity isn't just a simple label; it's a powerful concept used by listeners, critics, and musicians themselves to evaluate music. When we call something "authentic," we're often making a judgment about its quality, its connection to a tradition, or the sincerity of its creator.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Authenticity: Musical vs. Non-Musical Dimensions

-   **Musical Authenticity:** Based on sound elements.
    -   *Examples:* Swing feel in jazz, electric bağlama in arabesque, specific guitar tones in metal.
    -   *(Suno *can* replicate these sonic markers).*
-   **Non-Musical Authenticity:** Based on artist identity, origin, context.
    -   *Examples:* Gangsta rap credibility (Taylor, 1997), Chicago blues tourism (Becker, 2004).
    -   *(Suno inherently lacks this biographical/contextual dimension).*

{{% note %}}
We judge authenticity in different ways. Sometimes it's purely about the sound – does it have the right instruments, rhythms, and feel for the genre? Suno is getting quite good at mimicking these musical signifiers. Other times, authenticity is tied to *who* is making the music and *why*. Does the artist come from the community the music represents? Do they have the lived experience? This is where AI currently falls short, as it has no identity or background.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Authenticity: Ascribed, Not Inscribed

-   **Key Idea (Moore, 2002):** Authenticity is *assigned* by listeners/communities, not an inherent property of the music itself.
-   Values vary based on individual/collective perspectives.
-   No "universal" or "absolute" values defining authenticity for any genre.

{{% note %}}
This is a crucial point. Moore argues that there's nothing *objectively* authentic about a particular musical feature. Its authenticity is constructed through social agreement and interpretation. The same rhythm or instrument might be considered authentic in one context and inauthentic in another, depending on who is listening and what cultural framework they're using. Think about how the "authenticity" of blues music is debated – is it about certain scales, the performer's background, or the emotional expression? Different people will emphasize different aspects.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Authenticity & AI Music Perception

-   Because authenticity is *ascribed*, AI music *could* be perceived as "authentic" or "artificial" depending on the listener's value system.
    -   *(Connects to cultural relativism: values are context-dependent)*.

---

## Discussion Point: Ascribed Authenticity

*   How does the idea that authenticity is *ascribed* (assigned by listeners) change how you think about AI-generated music?
*   Could you personally accept AI music as "authentic" under certain conditions?
*   What might those conditions be (e.g., based on sound quality, emotional impact, novel style, transparency about its creation)?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To connect the theoretical concept of ascribed authenticity directly to the audience's potential perception of AI music. Encourage reflection on personal criteria for authenticity and whether AI could ever meet them. Prompt consideration of *why* or *why not*.

## Defining the "Musician"

-   Crucial for analyzing the role of AI music generator users.
-   Question seems obvious, but consider edge cases:
    -   Is a DJ a musician?
    -   A conductor?
    -   An amateur vs. a professional?
    -   Someone singing chants at a football match?

{{% note %}}
Before we can answer "Are we all musicians now?", we need a working definition of "musician." It's not always clear-cut. Does it require playing an instrument? Composing original works? Performing for others? What about roles that involve manipulating existing sounds (DJs) or guiding others' performances (conductors)? The lines can be blurry.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Defining "Musician": Turino's Framework

-   **Presentational Performance:** Clear artist/audience separation (e.g., concert).
-   **Participatory Performance:** Blurred lines, focus on collective engagement (e.g., campfire singalong, religious service, football chants).
    -   Musicianship is ambiguous from an *emic* (insider) perspective. Are participants "musicians"?

{{% note %}}
Ethnomusicologist Thomas Turino offers a useful distinction. Most professional music we consume is 'presentational'. But much music-making globally is 'participatory,' where the goal is inclusion, not necessarily artistic display for a separate audience. In these participatory settings, people engage musically, but might not identify themselves as 'musicians' in the Western sense. This highlights the tension between an observer's label (etic) and the participant's own understanding (emic).
{{% /note %}}

---

## Defining "Musician": A Working Definition

-   Adopted definition (Sağıroğlu, 2019):
    > **Musicians = "subjects who intervene in sounds and silences accepted as music with a specific intention (performance or composition)."**

---

## Discussion Point: Applying the Definition

*   Using Sağıroğlu's definition ("intervening in sounds... with intention"), where do these roles fit?
    *   A DJ mixing tracks?
    *   A conductor leading an orchestra?
    *   Someone using Suno with a detailed prompt?
    *   Someone using Suno with a simple prompt ("happy pop song")?
*   Does this definition feel too broad, too narrow, or about right?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To test the application of the proposed definition to various roles, including the Suno user. This helps clarify the boundaries of "musicianship" under this specific framework and invites critique of the definition itself. Encourage justification for each placement.

## Suno: The AI Music Generator

-   **Timeline:** Initial release (Dec 2023), v3 (Mar 2024), v3.5 (May 2024), v4 (Nov 2024).
-   **Founding Team:** Background in machine learning (e.g., at Kensho, working on audio transcription).
-   **Core Goal:** "building a future where anyone can make great music... No instrument needed, just imagination." (Suno website)

{{% note %}}
Suno emerged relatively recently but rapidly evolved its capabilities. The founders' background in ML and audio processing at Kensho provided relevant expertise. Their stated mission emphasizes democratization and accessibility, lowering the barrier to music creation by removing the need for traditional musical skills or instruments.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Suno: Raison d'être & Capability

-   **Suno's Claim:** "From your mind to music."
-   **v3:** Aimed for "radio-quality" music (2 mins).
-   **v3.5:** Extended duration (4 mins), improved song structures.
-   **v4:** Better audio quality, sharper lyrics, dynamic structures.

---

## Discussion Point: Creator or Commissioner?

*   Suno aims to turn imagination ("your mind") into music. How well does it deliver on this promise from your perspective or experience?
*   When using a tool like Suno, does the user feel more like the *creator* of the song, or like someone *commissioning* a song from the AI?
*   Where does the creative agency seem to lie?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To explore the subjective experience of using generative AI tools and probe the feeling of authorship. This gets at the core of the user's perceived role in the creative process – are they the artist, or the client directing the artist (the AI)?
{{% /note %}}

---

## Suno: User Interaction & Output

-   **Simple Mode:** Generate based on genre/style/theme description (instrumental option available).
    -   "Need ideas?" feature guides prompts (person, occasion, mood, activity).
-   **Custom Mode:** More control (user provides lyrics, etc.).
-   **Output:** Generates full song (vocals, instruments, lyrics, title, artwork) from prompts like "psychedelic UK garage song about a friend with a Nokia obsession."

{{% note %}}
Interaction is prompt-based. Users can give simple directions or, in custom mode (though not fully detailed in the source notes), provide more specific inputs like lyrics. The key takeaway is the speed and completeness of the output – a full package from a textual idea in seconds or minutes. The "need ideas" feature nudges users towards creative starting points, further lowering the barrier.
{{% /note %}}

## Suno: Ownership & Copyright

-   **Usage Rights:** Vary by subscription (Free, Pro, Premier).
    -   **Pro/Premier:** Can monetize generated music (YouTube, Spotify, etc.).
    -   **Free:** Non-commercial use only.
-   **Controversy:** AI models trained on vast datasets, raising copyright concerns.
    -   *Example:* "Heart On My Sleeve" (Fake Drake/Weeknd track) taken down after UMG request.

{{% note %}}
The business model ties usage rights to payment tiers, allowing commercial use for paying subscribers. This directly addresses the potential for using Suno for professional purposes (ads, background music, etc.). However, the underlying issue of training data looms large. The Ghostwriter977 incident exemplifies the legal and ethical challenges when AI mimics artists or potentially uses copyrighted material without permission in its training process. Suno, like many AI companies, has not been fully transparent about its exact training data sources.

## Analyzing Suno's Impact: Four Key Topics

1.  **Collective Musical Intelligence:** AI's collaborative nature?
2.  **Musicalization of Everyday Life:** Unconventional music creation.
3.  **Embracing Creation Playlists:** Beyond passive listening.
4.  **Is There an Author?** Locating creativity behind the machine.

{{% note %}}
To understand Suno's sociocultural significance, the paper focuses on these four areas. They address how AI relates to human musical heritage, how it changes creation practices, how we might interact with AI-generated content (though point 3 needs more detail from the original paper), and the fundamental question of authorship.
{{% /note %}}

---

### 1. Collective Musical Intelligence: AI as "Other"?

-   **Common Perception:** AI often viewed as an external "Other" (influenced by sci-fi like *Terminator*, *Matrix*).
-   **Distinction:** Need to separate narrow AI (like Suno) from hypothetical AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
-   **Suno's Foundation:** Built on *anthropocentric* training data (recorded music, speech). Founders acknowledge this but are vague on specifics.

{{% note %}}
Popular culture often portrays AI as an alien intelligence, potentially hostile. It's important to remember that current AI like Suno is specialized (narrow AI) and operates based on the human-created data it was trained on. It doesn't possess consciousness or general intelligence (AGI). Suno's outputs are reflections and recombinations of existing human musical expression found in its training data, even if the specific sources aren't disclosed. The user note "Well, it doesn't have a body, right??" highlights the intuitive perception of AI as fundamentally different and non-human.
{{% /note %}}

---

## 1. Collective Musical Intelligence: The Concept

-   **Argument:** Generative AI represents a form of **human collective intelligence**, accessed via prompts.
-   **Musical Context:** This can be termed **"collective musical intelligence."**
-   **Suno as Access Point:** Makes musical heritage (within training data limits) available to users, regardless of their prior musical knowledge (cultural capital).

{{% note %}}
The paper proposes reframing AI not as an "Other," but as a technological manifestation of collective human knowledge and creativity, drawn from its training data. In music, this means Suno taps into a vast repository of styles, techniques, and sounds created by countless human agents over time. It acts as an interface to this "collective musical intelligence." This framing attempts to bridge the gap between "artificial" and "natural." *However, the user notes raise valid criticisms: Training source doesn't equal identity, and AI lacks lived experience.* This concept is debatable.
{{% /note %}}

---

### 1. Collective Musical Intelligence: Authenticity & Challenges

-   **Potential for Authenticity:** Viewing AI output as accessing "collective musical intelligence" allows seeing the "human" behind the "machine," potentially grounding authenticity. (Analogous to Anderson's "imagined communities").
-   **Challenges:**
    -   Lacks **embodied cultural capital** (learned skills, lived experience).
    -   Relies on prompts + recorded data, not traditional musicianship.
    -   **Lack of transparency** about training data fuels copyright issues & perceptions of **inauthenticity**.

---

## Discussion Point: Collective Musical Intelligence

*   Does framing AI music generation as accessing "collective musical intelligence" resonate with you?
*   Does this perspective make AI music feel potentially more "authentic" or meaningful?
*   Or do the challenges (lack of embodiment, transparency issues) outweigh this conceptual reframing for you? Why?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To gauge audience reaction to this specific theoretical framing from the paper. Does it offer a useful way to think about AI music, or does it feel like an attempt to legitimize something fundamentally different? Encourage discussion on the tension between the concept and its practical/ethical limitations.
{{% /note %}}

---

## 1. Collective Musical Intelligence: Social Construction

-   Avoid **technological determinism** (idea that tech dictates social change).
-   Technology adoption is shaped by **social negotiation**.
-   **Future:** Legal/ethical debates around training data and ownership will shape the fate of AI music generators and their influence on music scenes.

{{% note %}}
Technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. How society adopts, regulates, and assigns meaning to AI music generators like Suno will determine their ultimate impact. The ongoing debates about copyright, ethics, and the value of AI-generated art are part of this social construction process. The outcome isn't predetermined by the technology itself.
{{% /note %}}

---

## 2. Musicalization of Everyday Life

-   **Traditional Music Production:** Labor-intensive, requires capital (cultural, social, economic), time.
-   **Suno:** Technology-intensive, compresses process into seconds via prompts.
-   **Potential:** Facilitates **experimental/unconventional** music; enables mass participation in the **musicalization of everyday life**.

{{% note %}}
Suno drastically reduces the time, skill, and resources needed to produce music, contrasting sharply with traditional methods described by Bourdieu. This opens the door for uses beyond conventional artistic expression – creating quick jingles, personalized songs, musicalizing mundane moments, or experimenting in ways that would be too time-consuming otherwise. This aligns with Suno's democratization claim. *User notes raise questions: Is this ease always good? Is experimental output truly easy to achieve? Do we need *more* ambient, less intentional music (cf. Muzak)?*
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion Point: Musicalizing Daily Life

*   What are your thoughts on AI enabling the "musicalization of everyday life"? Is this an exciting prospect or a potential source of noise/trivialization?
*   What are the potential benefits (e.g., personal expression, fun, accessibility)?
*   What are the potential drawbacks (e.g., devaluing crafted music, information overload, lack of intention)?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To explore the implications of making music creation instantaneous and ubiquitous. Encourage consideration of both the positive potential (democratization, new forms of expression) and the negative possibilities (oversaturation, reduced appreciation for skill/intent).
{{% /note %}}

---

## 4. Is There an Author? Behind the Machine

-   **Author:** Perceived creative agent behind a work.
-   **Complexity:** Clearer in Western art music (composer) vs. popular music (multiple contributors: producer, songwriter, artist, etc.).
-   **How does this apply to Suno?** Three perspectives...

{{% note %}}
The question of authorship is central when discussing creativity and ownership. While we often default to a single "composer" in classical music, popular music already involves more collaborative and distributed forms of authorship. AI generation complicates this even further.
{{% /note %}}

---

### 4. Authorship Perspective 

**1: The Void / Simulacra**

-   Music lacks a "real" author: no "real" voices, instruments, or direct human performance (except potential audio uploads).
-   Hiatt (2024) on Suno blues: "no human behind the voice, no hand on the guitar."
-   **Baudrillard's Simulacra:** Representations detached from reality, forming their own hyperreality. Suno produces musical simulacra, severing the link to original human actions/intent.

{{% note %}}
This perspective argues that because the sounds are synthesized and not directly produced by human performers in the moment, there's an absence of traditional authorship. The music becomes a simulation – it *sounds like* blues, but the human element traditionally associated with blues performance is missing. It's a copy without a direct original source in the performance act itself, fitting Baudrillard's idea of simulacra where the sign (the sound) is detached from the expected signified (a person playing/singing).
{{% /note %}}

---

### 4. Authorship Perspective 

**2: The Collective Subject**

-   Examine the **training data** (the "collective musical intelligence").
-   Authorship resides not in one person, but in the **collective** of musicians/creators whose work informed the AI.
-   Challenges traditional notions but recognizes authorship can evolve.

{{% note %}}
This view shifts the focus from the final output or the user prompt to the *source* material. If Suno learns from countless human musicians, perhaps the authorship is distributed among all of them. This is a radical reframing, moving away from individual genius towards a collective, historical view of creativity, mediated by the AI. It acknowledges the human labor embedded in the training data.
{{% /note %}}

---

### 4. Authorship Perspective 

**3: The User as Author/Curator**

-   Users are responsible for initiating unique productions via prompts (detailed or simple).
-   Even simple prompts involve **curation** (selecting the prompt itself).
-   **Curation Actions:** Extending, cropping, replacing sections = creative filtering ("selecting and discarding").

---

## Discussion Point: Locating Authorship

*   Which of the three perspectives on AI music authorship resonates most with you?
    *   The Void / Simulacra (No real author)
    *   The Collective Subject (Authorship = the training data contributors)
    *   The User as Author/Curator (Authorship = the prompter/editor)
*   Can these perspectives coexist? For instance, could the user be the *curator* while the *collective* provides the raw material?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To directly engage the audience with the different theoretical ways of assigning authorship to AI-generated music presented in the paper. Encourage them to weigh the arguments and consider hybrid viewpoints. This highlights the complexity and contested nature of authorship in this new context.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Discussion: Are We All Musicians Now?

-   **Answer:** Potentially **"Yes" AND "No."**
-   **Using Sağıroğlu's Definition:** ("intervene in sounds... with specific intention")
    -   Suno users *do* intervene: selecting genre, mood, theme, lyrics, instruments, uploading audio.
    -   They act with **intention** (to compose/create a piece of music).
-   Therefore, users *could* be positioned as **authors** and **musicians**.

{{% note %}}
Revisiting the definition of a musician as someone who intentionally intervenes in sound, Suno users arguably fit. They make choices that directly shape the musical output. The prompt is an intervention, specifying desired characteristics. The *degree* of intervention varies hugely, from simple prompts to detailed custom lyrics and structure, but the act of intentional intervention is present.
{{% /note %}}

---

### Discussion: Musicianship as Intervention & Curation

-   **Intervention:** Users make choices about genre, style, mood, theme, lyrics, instrumentation.
-   **Curation:**
    -   Selecting specific outputs from multiple generations.
    -   Editing: "extending," "cropping," "replacing sections."
-   This "selecting and discarding" is akin to DJ curation and can be seen as **musicianship**.
-   **Amateur vs. Professional:** Tied to subscription plan/monetization rights.

---

## Discussion Point: Redefining Musicianship?

*   Do you agree that using tools like Suno, involving intervention and curation, constitutes a form of **musicianship**?
*   How does this "AI-assisted musicianship" compare to traditional musicianship (instrumental skill, composition theory, performance practice)?
*   Is "curation" a valid form of musical creativity in this context?

{{% note %}}
Purpose: To directly address the paper's core argument about Suno users potentially qualifying as musicians. Encourage a comparative discussion between traditional skills and the skills involved in using AI tools (prompting, curating, editing). Prompt debate on the value and validity of "curation as creativity."
{{% /note %}}

---

## Conclusion: Democratization & Impact

-   Suno exemplifies music production shifting from **labor-intensive** to **technology-intensive**.
-   Furthers the **democratization of music** production access.
-   Contributes to the **democratization of musicianship** itself (redefining who counts as a musician).

{{% note %}}
The paper concludes that Suno and similar tools represent a significant shift, making the *means* of music production accessible to anyone with an internet connection and an idea, regardless of traditional training. This lowers barriers not just to making *music*, but potentially to identifying as a *musician*, albeit under a potentially new definition.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Conclusion: Future Implications

-   **Industry Impact:** Plausible that AI music generators replace human composers/musicians for functional music needs (film, ads, games).
    -   Suno's Pro/Premier ownership rights support this.
-   Raises ongoing questions about value, creativity, and the future role of human artists.

{{% note %}}
The practical implications could be significant, especially in areas where music serves a functional purpose and budgets are tight. The ability for commercial users to own and monetize Suno outputs makes it a viable tool for these industries. This inevitably leads to larger discussions about the economic impact on human musicians and the evolving definition of artistic value in an age of increasingly capable AI.
