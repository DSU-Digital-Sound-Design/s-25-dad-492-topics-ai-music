# Week 1 (1/13): Introduction to AI and Creativity

## Tuesday

- Syllabus Review
- **Topics**: Overview of course themes, questions: “What does it mean to make music with AI?” and “Is this even a good idea?”
- **Key Concepts**: Brainard’s creativity framework (novelty, value, agency, curiosity).
- Discussion
  - When you hear the term 'AI music,' what comes to mind?
  - What are some examples of how you think AI might be used to create music?
  - What are your initial feelings or reactions to the idea of AI creating music?
- Listen to some tracks from [Suno](https://suno.com/) and [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/).
  - Take some notes on what you hear and how you feel about it. Focus on musical elements. 
- Discussion
  - What aspect of the music helped you tell that it was created by an AI system?
  - Would you listen to any of this music again? Why or why not?
  - What's the place of music like this in society?
