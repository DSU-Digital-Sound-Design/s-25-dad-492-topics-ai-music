DAD 492: AI Music explores how artificial intelligence intersects with music creation, examining questions of creativity, curiosity, and connection. The course balances practical projects—such as building generative music systems and interactive AI tools—with critical discussions on AI's aesthetic, ethical, and social dimensions in the arts. Students will reflect on AI's potential to augment human creativity while grappling with its limitations, such as its lack of agency and curiosity. Through hands-on work and philosophical inquiry, the course challenges students to consider how AI can augment, rather than replace, human expression.
