# Etude 1 - Sonic Poetry Generator 

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a sonic poetry generator that explores the relationship between words and sound. Building upon our [in-class examples](../lectures/week-2/word2vec-intro/), you will implement one musical extension that demonstrates your understanding of synthesis, sound design, or music theory.

## Core Requirements

### Basic Implementation (Required)
1. Load and use the word2vec model to find related words
2. Create a basic melody system
3. Display words on screen with animation
4. Include start/stop functionality
5. Handle errors appropriately

### Musical Extension (Choose One)
Select one of these extensions to make the poetry generator your own. Each option emphasizes different aspects of sound design or music theory.

#### Extension 1: Timbre Evolution
Create meaningful relationships between words and synthesizer timbre. 

Implementation guidance:
- Start by modifying the oscillator type between sine and triangle for different words
- Experiment with attack and release times to create different note characteristics
- Consider how word relationships might map to timbral qualities (e.g., similar words = warm tones, distant words = bright tones)

#### Extension 2: Musical Intervals
Design melodic relationships using specific musical intervals based on word relationships. 

Implementation guidance:
- Begin with simple mappings like major thirds for similar words
- Add minor intervals for more distant relationships
- Create small collections of intervals that work well together
- Consider using pentatonic scales to ensure pleasant combinations

#### Extension 3: Effects Processing
Change audio effects as the poem progresses depending on the word relationships.

Implementation guidance:
- Start with subtle reverb adjustments
- Add delay for more distant word relationships
- Keep effect levels moderate to maintain clarity
- Consider how the space changes with different word combinations

## Assessment Rubric (50 points)

### Core Functionality (25 points)
- Word generation works correctly (7 points)
- Basic audio plays reliably (7 points)
- Visual display functions (7 points)
- Start/stop works properly (4 points)

### Musical Extension (17 points)
- Sonic implementation (6 points)
- Musical effectiveness (6 points)
- Creative use of parameters (5 points)

### Documentation and Process (8 points)
- Documentation of musical choices (3 points)
- Clear explanation of parameters (3 points)
- Thoughtful sound design decisions (2 points)


## Submission Requirements
1. Your code with clear comments explaining audio parameters
2. A brief write-up explaining:
   - Which extension you chose and why
   - How your sound design relates to word relationships
   - Your musical decision-making process
3. A short video demonstration with audio
